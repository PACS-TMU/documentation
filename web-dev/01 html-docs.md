**Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML)** is the standard markup language for creating and structuring content on the World Wide Web. It consists of a set of elements and tags that define the various components of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more. HTML documents are plain text files that browsers interpret to render web pages, with tags providing instructions on how content should be displayed and organized. By combining HTML with CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity, web developers can create rich and dynamic websites, making HTML a fundamental building block of the internet.
