**Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)** is a stylesheet language used in web development to control the presentation and visual styling of HTML and XML documents. It allows designers and developers to define how elements on a web page should look, including attributes like colors, fonts, spacing, layout, and responsiveness to different screen sizes. CSS separates the content and structure of a web page (handled by HTML) from its visual design, making it an essential tool for creating visually appealing and consistent websites, and ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices and screen sizes.
