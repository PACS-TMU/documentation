# Data Science Documentation - Getting Started
<sup style="display: inline-block;">**Note:** This document is meant for internal PACS use only.</sup>

This documentation is going to cover all the necessary installations to start using Data Science in PACS.

## Section 1: Installing Python 3
### Check if you already have python:
1. Open command prompt
2.  - On windows: Type `python --version`
    - On MacOS: Type `python3 --version`
3. Check the output:
    - If the output says `Python 3.XX.X`, python is already installed. You can proceed to Section 2.
    - If the output says `Python 2.XX.X` or `python is not recognized` (or a message along those lines), python is not installed. Proceed to the windows installation below.

## Section 2: Installing PyCharm (or other IDE) 

## Section 3: Installing `NumPy` and `pandas` - pip

## Section 4: Installing Jupyter Notebook

<sup style="display: inline-block;">**Note:** Moving forward, basic knowledge of python is required (conditionals, loops, etc.).</sup>
