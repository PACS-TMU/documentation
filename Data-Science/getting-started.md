# Data Science Documentation - Getting Started
<sup style="display: inline-block;">**Note:** This document is meant for internal PACS use only.</sup>

This documentation is going to cover all the necessary installations to start using Data Science in PACS.

## Section 1: Installing Python 3
1. Check if you already have python:
   <br />
   <details>
	<summary>For Windows</summary>

 	<br />

   	Open Command Prompt
   
 	<br />
 
    </details>
    <details>
	<summary>For MacOS</summary>

 	<br />

   	Open Terminal
   
 	<br />
 
    </details>
2. Check your Python version:
   <br />
   <details>
	<summary>For Windows</summary>

 	<br />

   	>In your command prompt, type:
   
 	<br />
  
	```
	python --version
	```
 
    </details>
    <details>
	<summary>For MacOS</summary>

 	<br />

   	>In your terminal, type:
   
 	<br />
  
	```
	python3 --version
	```
 
     </details>

3. Check the output:
    - If the output says `Python 3.XX.X`, python is already installed. You can proceed to [Section 2](#section-2-installing-pycharm-or-other-ide).
    - If the output says `Python 2.XX.X` or `python is not recognized` (or a message along those lines), python is not installed. Proceed to the windows installation below.

4. Installing Python 3:
    - For Windows,
        - Follow the link to the <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/" target="_blank">official python Windows releases</a>
    - For MacOS,
        - Follow the link to the <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/" target="_blank">official python MacOS releases</a>
    - Select the latest Stable Release
    - For Windows,
        - Scroll to the bottom and select `Windows installer (32-bit)` or `Windows installer (64-bit)`, depending on your Windows system (64-bit is usually more common)
    - For MacOS,
    	- Scroll to the bottom and select `macOS 64-bit universal2 installer`
    - After the installer download is complete, open it and go through the installation steps
    - If asked to add Python to PATH, select that option.

## Section 2: Installing PyCharm (or other IDE) 
Some common IDEs used for Python projects are:
- <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installation-guide.html" target="_blank">PyCharm (recommended)</a>
- <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code (VSCode)</a>
- <a href="https://docs.spyder-ide.org/3/installation.html" target="_blank">Spyder</a>
- and many more...

For Data Science purposes, we will mainly be using Jupyter Notebook. However, we strongly recommend PyCharm as your day-to-day IDE for Python projects and scripts. Follow the links above to install the IDE of your choice.

## Section 3: Installing `NumPy` and `pandas` - pip

## Section 4: Installing Jupyter Notebook

<sup style="display: inline-block;">**Note:** Moving forward, basic knowledge of python is required (conditionals, loops, etc.).</sup>
