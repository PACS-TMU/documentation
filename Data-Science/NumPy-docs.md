## What is Numpy - Quick Summary
NumPy is the fundemental library for numerical and scientific computation in Python. The library offers a multi-dimensional array object, and various objects derived from it. NumPy is faster than using regular Python because the array object is homogeneous (it only allows one type of object to be stored in it, i.e., a NumPy array can be all integers, all strings, etc., but not a mix of objects). The multi-dimensional array object is NumPy is called ndarray (N-Dimensional Array) by convention.
