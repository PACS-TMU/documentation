## What is Numpy - Quick Summary
NumPy is the fundemental library for numerical and scientific computation in Python. The library offers a multi-dimensional array object, and various objects derived from it. NumPy is faster than using regular Python because the array object is homogeneous (it only allows one type of object to be stored in it, i.e., a NumPy array can be all integers, all strings, etc., but not a mix of objects). The multi-dimensional array object is NumPy is called ndarray (N-Dimensional Array) by convention.

## Importing NumPy - Creating your First NumPy Array
To import NumPy, we can add the following line of code at the top of our Python file:
```
import numpy as np
```
>Note: The import statement above only works if you have installed NumPy. To install NumPy, follow the tutorial in <a href="https://github.com/PACS-TMU/documentation/blob/main/Data-Science/00%20getting-started.md#section-3-installing-numpy-and-pandas---pip" target="_blank">this doc</a>.
